# 100 Days of Code

## I am currently undergoing the 100 Days of Code Challenge offered by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. I will be regularily updating this repository with my completion of each daily project challenge. As well, I am using this as an opportunity to learn how to use GitHub. Please look forward to my progress.
